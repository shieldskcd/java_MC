# java_MC
- This repository for the Java MasterClass on Udemy. 
- The material is taught by Tim Buchalka and is over 135 hours of material. 

## Section 01
The first section consisted only of introduction videos about what the instructor wants us to know. It encourages the programmer to stay active on their journey, to use the Q&A functions, and to learn by coding, not by just watching or copying code directly. 

### Chapter 8
At the end of the first chapter, the author mentions the differece between standard Java and LTS Java

- **LTS** Java means *Long Term Support* Java. Oracle makes updates to Java a few times per year. Most versions are only supported for about 6 months to a year. However, LTS versions have extended support, security fixes and compatibility. 
- The author suggests that we focus on only using LTS versions of Java to avoid problems with our code in the future. 
- The current LTS is JDK 17 even though JDK 21 is available. The next time a full LTS version is made, the useful features of the previous JDKs will be merged into the system.

## Section 02
The second section of the course discusses how to install the Java SDK on your device and how to confirm that everytying is working. 

- We installed Java 17 LTS

### Chapter 14
In this chapter, the instructor wants us to confirm that we have java installed and that it is the right version. 

- To do this, we openened a command prompt and typed the following code:
    `java -version`
- My version shows that I have:
    > java version 17.0.14
- We also wrote saw a code block that I attempted to recreate.
- Next, we spent some time practicing JShell and understanding how it works.

## Section 03
Section 3 of the material focuses on how to do more basic programming in Java such as using operators and modifying variables. 

### Chapter 15 - Writing our First Code
- We first created a simple JShell command to print our HelloWorld program
- We discussed the basics of variables and operators. 
- We discussed Error Handling basics 

### Chapter 16 - Introduction to Variables, Keywords, and Integer (int) data types
- This chapter allowed us to do some more actual coding in JShell.
- We discussed *keywords* and *variables* in more detail
- We did some exercises to help us get comfortable with changing variable values and adding new variables.
- We reviewed the `/list` feature in JShell that shows us all commands in a session. 
- We discussed complex variables and how we can use basic mathematical operators (like plus, minus, multiply and divide). 

### Chapter 17 - Comprehensive Introduction Guide to Using Variables in Java Expressions
- This chapter was a deeper dive into creating Java expressions using operators.
- There were two challenges in this chapter
    - The first challenge focused on creating two new variables and adding them to the first variable
    - The second challenge focused on creating additional variables and using operators to automatically do mathematical operations when declaring variables. 
- The chapter ended with some important notes about syntax such as what part capitalization plays in this and the best format for variables. 

### Chapter 18 - Exploring Integer Ranges and Wrapper Classes
