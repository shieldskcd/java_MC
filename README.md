# java_MC
- This repository for the Java MasterClass on Udemy. 
- The material is taught by Tim Buchalka and is over 135 hours of material. 

## Chapter 1
The first chapter consisted only of introduction videos about what the instructor wants us to know. It encourages the programmer to stay active on their journey, to use the Q&A functions, and to learn by coding, not by just watching or copying code directly. 

### Section 8
At the end of the first chapter, the author mentions the differece between standard Java and LTS Java

- **LTS** Java means *Long Term Support* Java. Oracle makes updates to Java a few times per year. Most versions are only supported for about 6 months to a year. However, LTS versions have extended support, security fixes and compatibility. 
- The author suggests that we focus on only using LTS versions of Java to avoid problems with our code in the future. 
- The current LTS is JDK 17 even though JDK 21 is available. The next time a full LTS version is made, the useful features of the previous JDKs will be merged into the system.
