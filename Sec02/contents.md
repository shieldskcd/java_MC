# Section 2 Material
This is the notes from Section 2 in the course. 

## Chapter 14
- Installed JDK 17 LTS
- Confirmed our Java Version via command prompt
-- 'java -version'
- Experimented with our first program (HelloWorld.java) 
- Talked about JShell

### JShell
The instructor explanes the values of the Java Shell (JShell) tool for executing java code. 

- JShell became standard in JDK 9
- It is a *Read-Eval-Print-Loop* (REPL) tool which completes the following steps:
    - it **reads** the command or code we type in.
    - it **evaluates** and executes the code and often allows shortcuts to be used. 
    - it **prints** out the results of the evaluation or execution without making us write out the code. 
    - Lastly, it loops back out to serve as a sandbox. 
- JShell is **not** a replacement for an IDE.
